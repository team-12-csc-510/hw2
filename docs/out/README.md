|Notes|Score(44)| Evidence|
|-----|---------|---------|
|Video1| N/A | Not required for Homeworks |
|Video2|N/A| Not required for Homeworks|
|Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)| 3 | I observed the [work division](https://github.com/nakraft/CSC510/graphs/contributors) and its evident that the work was equally divided.   |
|Number of commits|3| The homeworks have 110 commits with each commit having atomic changes which seem to be appropirate|
|Number of commits: by different people| 3 | All the team members have commits |
|Issues reports: there are **many**| 0 | No issues reported. The team has had issues with [hw2](https://discord.com/channels/1009547855301718107/1009554548353941625/1021963230500900955) and an issues should have been created for that.|
|Issues are being closed| 0 | No issues reported and closed. |
|DOI badge: exists|3| Badge exists.|
|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly | 0 | I donot see any documentation for the code.Docstrings are missing.|
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) | 0 | No documentation. |
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z| 0 | No documentation. |
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing| 0 | No documentation. |
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|  0 | No documentation. |
|Use of version control tools| 3 | Github was used. The team used different [branches](https://github.com/nakraft/CSC510/branches) for adding features which is a good practice. |
|Use of style checkers | 0 | No style checker present. The team could have used pre/post commit hooks and some tools like flake, isort etc. for code quality and style |
|Use of code formatters. |0 | No style checker present. The team could have used pre/post commit hooks and some tools like flake, isort etc. for code quality and style |
|Use of syntax checkers. |0 | No style checker present. The team could have used pre/post commit hooks and some tools like flake, isort etc. for code quality and style |
|Use of code coverage |3| The code coverage was successfully integrated for HW4. |
|Other automated analysis tools| 2 | Apart from code coverage no other auto analysis has been added. |
|Test cases exist|3| [tests](https://github.com/nakraft/CSC510/tree/main/test)
|Test cases are routinely executed| 3 | The test cases are being executed inside actions. |
|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up| 3 | The [file](https://github.com/nakraft/CSC510/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) has all the necessary details.
|Issues are discussed before they are closed| 0 | No issues created.
|Chat channel: exists| 0 | No chat channel link provided. |
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|3| Looking at the history of commits the team has handled this well |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files| 3 |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)| 3 |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)| N/A |
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base| 3 |
|Short release cycles |  3 |
